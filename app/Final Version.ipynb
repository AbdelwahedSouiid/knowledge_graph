Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n 1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management \\n The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management   is to ( a  ) provide a standard for project \\nmanagement practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ  nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that \\nare recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b  ) provide a standard that is globally \\napplicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. \\n The  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  covers risk management as it is applied to single \\nprojects only. Like the  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs \\nor portfolios of projects. \\n Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk \\nManagement . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. \\n Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide  – Fourth Edition \\nand textbooks, handbooks, and courses. \\n Figure 1-1.

Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to \\nProject Risk Management processes as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition. \\n 2.  Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth \\nEdition. The six processes are as follows: \\n Plan Risk Management, • \\n Identify Risks, • \\n Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, • \\n Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, • \\n Plan Risk Responses, and • \\n Monitor and Control Risks. • \\n Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: \\n( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and \\ntechniques for the process; and ( d    ) documenting the results of the process. \\n 3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. \\n This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, \\nand successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for \\nseveral reasons: \\n 1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and \\ntechniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \\n 2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \\nManagement. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \\napply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is \\ntailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There \\nare many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. \\n 3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, reﬂ  ecting the many \\nbusiness and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures \\nbetween commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. \\n The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can \\nestablish processes speciﬁ  c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.</td>\n",

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n 1.2 Project Risk Management Deﬁ  nition \\n The deﬁ  nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis \\nfor this practice standard: “Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting \\nrisk management planning, identiﬁ  cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the \\nprobability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the \\nproject.” In the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, \\nhas a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. \\n Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide \\naction-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may \\nor may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. \\n 1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \\n Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. \\nIt should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In \\nthis way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. \\n Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ  nal design \\nand from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often \\nassume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. \\n Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it \\nbuilds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates \\nand critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. \\n Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, \\nProject Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ  dence for meeting project objectives.</td>\n",

In the early stages of a project, the level of \\nrisk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not \\nmean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different \\nways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the \\nmore realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. \\n A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life \\ncycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk \\nmanagement continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ  exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. \\n It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in \\nplace, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. \\nDuring project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. \\n Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to \\ncontribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice. \\n 1.4 Good Risk Management Practice \\n Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of \\nthe other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be \\nconducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the \\nmulti-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. \\n Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may \\nrequire decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.</td>\n",

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project \\nManagement code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing \\nwith others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk \\nManagement beneﬁ  ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement \\namong stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ  cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable inﬂ  uences. \\n Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of \\ntools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the \\ncharacteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted \\nin the background with a ﬂ  exible deadline. \\n Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under \\nmanagement during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate. \\n 1.5 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \\n Figure 1-2.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n 1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management \\n The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management   is to ( a  ) provide a standard for project \\nmanagement practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ  nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that \\nare recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b  ) provide a standard that is globally \\napplicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. \\n The  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  covers risk management as it is applied to single \\nprojects only. Like the  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs \\nor portfolios of projects. \\n Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk \\nManagement . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. \\n Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide  – Fourth Edition \\nand textbooks, handbooks, and courses. \\n Figure 1-1.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n This practice standard is organized in three main sections: \\n 1.  Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to \\nProject Risk Management processes as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition. \\n 2.  Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth \\nEdition. The six processes are as follows: \\n Plan Risk Management, • \\n Identify Risks, • \\n Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, • \\n Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, • \\n Plan Risk Responses, and • \\n Monitor and Control Risks. • \\n Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: \\n( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and \\ntechniques for the process; and ( d    ) documenting the results of the process. \\n 3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. \\n This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, \\nand successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for \\nseveral reasons: \\n 1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and \\ntechniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \\n 2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \\nManagement. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \\napply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is \\ntailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There \\nare many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. \\n 3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, reﬂ  ecting the many \\nbusiness and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures \\nbetween commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. \\n The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can \\nestablish processes speciﬁ  c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.    \n",

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n 1.2 Project Risk Management Deﬁ  nition \\n The deﬁ  nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis \\nfor this practice standard: “Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting \\nrisk management planning, identiﬁ  cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the \\nprobability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the \\nproject.” In the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, \\nhas a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. \\n Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide \\naction-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may \\nor may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. \\n 1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \\n Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. \\nIt should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In \\nthis way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. \\n Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ  nal design \\nand from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often \\nassume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. \\n Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it \\nbuilds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates \\nand critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. \\n Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, \\nProject Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ  dence for meeting project objectives.    \n",

In the early stages of a project, the level of \\nrisk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not \\nmean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different \\nways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the \\nmore realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. \\n A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life \\ncycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk \\nmanagement continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ  exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. \\n It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in \\nplace, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. \\nDuring project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. \\n Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to \\ncontribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice. \\n 1.4 Good Risk Management Practice \\n Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of \\nthe other project management processes.

Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing \\nwith others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk \\nManagement beneﬁ  ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement \\namong stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ  cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable inﬂ  uences. \\n Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of \\ntools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the \\ncharacteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted \\nin the background with a ﬂ  exible deadline. \\n Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under \\nmanagement during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate. \\n 1.5 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \\n Figure 1-2.

This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. \\n The  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  covers risk management as it is applied to single \\nprojects only. Like the  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs \\nor portfolios of projects. \\n Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk \\nManagement . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. \\n Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide  – Fourth Edition \\nand textbooks, handbooks, and courses. \\n Figure 1-1.

Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to \\nProject Risk Management processes as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition. \\n 2.  Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth \\nEdition. The six processes are as follows: \\n Plan Risk Management, • \\n Identify Risks, • \\n Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, • \\n Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, • \\n Plan Risk Responses, and • \\n Monitor and Control Risks. • \\n Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: \\n( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and \\ntechniques for the process; and ( d    ) documenting the results of the process. \\n 3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. \\n This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, \\nand successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for \\nseveral reasons: \\n 1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and \\ntechniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \\n 2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \\nManagement. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \\napply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is \\ntailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There \\nare many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. \\n 3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, reﬂ  ecting the many \\nbusiness and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures \\nbetween commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. \\n The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can \\nestablish processes speciﬁ  c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.</td>\n",

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n 1.2 Project Risk Management Deﬁ  nition \\n The deﬁ  nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis \\nfor this practice standard: “Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting \\nrisk management planning, identiﬁ  cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the \\nprobability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the \\nproject.” In the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, \\nhas a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. \\n Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide \\naction-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may \\nor may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. \\n 1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \\n Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. \\nIt should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In \\nthis way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. \\n Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ  nal design \\nand from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often \\nassume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. \\n Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it \\nbuilds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates \\nand critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. \\n Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, \\nProject Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ  dence for meeting project objectives.</td>\n",

In the early stages of a project, the level of \\nrisk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not \\nmean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different \\nways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the \\nmore realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. \\n A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life \\ncycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk \\nmanagement continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ  exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. \\n It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in \\nplace, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. \\nDuring project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. \\n Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to \\ncontribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice. \\n 1.4 Good Risk Management Practice \\n Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of \\nthe other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be \\nconducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the \\nmulti-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. \\n Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may \\nrequire decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.</td>\n",

This information can be useful when reporting up the organization to those responsible for several projects. In addition, once a \\ncorresponding risk occurs or ceases to be current (i.e. when it can no longer impact the project), the corresponding reserve needs to be reviewed in order to assess whether it still provides the agreed level of confidence. \\n Time buffers can be used in two different ways: \\n To provide for accepted schedule risks, as described above or • \\n As a scheduling-related technique in critical chain project management (CCPM). • \\n In contrast with the contingency reserve for identified risks, the buffers in CCPM provide a shared \\nmechanism for accommodating the natural variability of activity durations over a sequence (or chain) of \\nactivities.

The Earned Value formulae of the “to complete performance index” can be used to assess changes with respect to time and cost. No templates or examples are presented. \\n D.6.1.6 Variance Analysis \\n The formulae in Earned Value Analysis (CV, SV, CPI, SPI) can be used to set thresholds for action, and to \\nindicate when the risk process may be ineffective. Earned value management systems (EVMS) use variance from plan as the basis of forecasts or extrapolations to the cost at completion. Projections made using EVMS have been shown by experience to be reliable early in the project, e.g., 20% into the execution. No templates or examples are presented.</td>\n",

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n 1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management \\n The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management   is to ( a  ) provide a standard for project \\nmanagement practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ  nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that \\nare recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b  ) provide a standard that is globally \\napplicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. \\n The  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  covers risk management as it is applied to single \\nprojects only. Like the  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs \\nor portfolios of projects. \\n Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk \\nManagement . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n This practice standard is organized in three main sections: \\n 1.  Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to \\nProject Risk Management processes as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition. \\n 2.  Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth \\nEdition. The six processes are as follows: \\n Plan Risk Management, • \\n Identify Risks, • \\n Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, • \\n Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, • \\n Plan Risk Responses, and • \\n Monitor and Control Risks. • \\n Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: \\n( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and \\ntechniques for the process; and ( d    ) documenting the results of the process. \\n 3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. \\n This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, \\nand successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for \\nseveral reasons: \\n 1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and \\ntechniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \\n 2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \\nManagement. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \\napply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is \\ntailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There \\nare many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. \\n 3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, reﬂ  ecting the many \\nbusiness and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures \\nbetween commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. \\n The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can \\nestablish processes speciﬁ  c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.    \n",

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n 1.2 Project Risk Management Deﬁ  nition \\n The deﬁ  nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis \\nfor this practice standard: “Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting \\nrisk management planning, identiﬁ  cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the \\nprobability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the \\nproject.” In the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, \\nhas a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. \\n Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide \\naction-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may \\nor may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. \\n 1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \\n Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. \\nIt should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In \\nthis way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. \\n Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ  nal design \\nand from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often \\nassume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. \\n Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it \\nbuilds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates \\nand critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. \\n Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, \\nProject Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ  dence for meeting project objectives.    \n",
       "3   5©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n There is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of \\nrisk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not \\nmean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different \\nways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the \\nmore realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. \\n A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life \\ncycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk \\nmanagement continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ  exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. \\n It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in \\nplace, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. \\nDuring project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. \\n Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to \\ncontribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice. \\n 1.4 Good Risk Management Practice \\n Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of \\nthe other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be \\nconducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the \\nmulti-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. \\n Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may \\nrequire decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.    \n",

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project \\nManagement code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing \\nwith others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk \\nManagement beneﬁ  ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement \\namong stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ  cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable inﬂ  uences. \\n Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of \\ntools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the \\ncharacteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted \\nin the background with a ﬂ  exible deadline. \\n Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under \\nmanagement during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate. \\n 1.5 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \\n Figure 1-2.

Tracking the state of the reserve through project execution will provide summary information as to the evolution of the status of the corresponding risks. This information can be useful when reporting up the organization to those responsible for several projects. In addition, once a \\ncorresponding risk occurs or ceases to be current (i.e. when it can no longer impact the project), the corresponding reserve needs to be reviewed in order to assess whether it still provides the agreed level of confidence. \\n Time buffers can be used in two different ways: \\n To provide for accepted schedule risks, as described above or • \\n As a scheduling-related technique in critical chain project management (CCPM). • \\n In contrast with the contingency reserve for identified risks, the buffers in CCPM provide a shared \\nmechanism for accommodating the natural variability of activity durations over a sequence (or chain) of \\nactivities.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n 1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management \\n The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management   is to ( a  ) provide a standard for project \\nmanagement practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ  nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that \\nare recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b  ) provide a standard that is globally \\napplicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. \\n The  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  covers risk management as it is applied to single \\nprojects only. Like the  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs \\nor portfolios of projects. \\n Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk \\nManagement . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. \\n Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide  – Fourth Edition \\nand textbooks, handbooks, and courses. \\n Figure 1-1.

Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to \\nProject Risk Management processes as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition. \\n 2.  Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth \\nEdition. The six processes are as follows: \\n Plan Risk Management, • \\n Identify Risks, • \\n Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, • \\n Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, • \\n Plan Risk Responses, and • \\n Monitor and Control Risks. • \\n Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: \\n( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and \\ntechniques for the process; and ( d    ) documenting the results of the process. \\n 3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. \\n This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, \\nand successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for \\nseveral reasons: \\n 1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and \\ntechniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \\n 2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \\nManagement. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \\napply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is \\ntailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There \\nare many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. \\n 3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, reﬂ  ecting the many \\nbusiness and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures \\nbetween commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. \\n The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can \\nestablish processes speciﬁ  c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.</td>\n",

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n 1.2 Project Risk Management Deﬁ  nition \\n The deﬁ  nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis \\nfor this practice standard: “Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting \\nrisk management planning, identiﬁ  cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the \\nprobability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the \\nproject.” In the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, \\nhas a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. \\n Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide \\naction-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may \\nor may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. \\n 1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \\n Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. \\nIt should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In \\nthis way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. \\n Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ  nal design \\nand from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often \\nassume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. \\n Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it \\nbuilds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates \\nand critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. \\n Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, \\nProject Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ  dence for meeting project objectives.</td>\n",

In the early stages of a project, the level of \\nrisk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not \\nmean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different \\nways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the \\nmore realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. \\n A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life \\ncycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk \\nmanagement continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ  exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. \\n It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in \\nplace, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. \\nDuring project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. \\n Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to \\ncontribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice. \\n 1.4 Good Risk Management Practice \\n Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of \\nthe other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be \\nconducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the \\nmulti-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. \\n Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may \\nrequire decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.</td>\n",

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project \\nManagement code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing \\nwith others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk \\nManagement beneﬁ  ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement \\namong stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ  cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable inﬂ  uences. \\n Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of \\ntools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the \\ncharacteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted \\nin the background with a ﬂ  exible deadline. \\n Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under \\nmanagement during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate. \\n 1.5 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \\n Figure 1-2.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n 1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management \\n The purpose of the  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management   is to ( a  ) provide a standard for project \\nmanagement practitioners and other stakeholders that deﬁ  nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that \\nare recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and ( b  ) provide a standard that is globally \\napplicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for training or educational purposes. \\n The  Practice Standard for Project Risk Management  covers risk management as it is applied to single \\nprojects only. Like the  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs \\nor portfolios of projects. \\n Chapter 11 of the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition, is the basis for the  Practice Standard for Project Risk \\nManagement . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles relating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards. \\n Figure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide  – Fourth Edition \\nand textbooks, handbooks, and courses. \\n Figure 1-1.

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n This practice standard is organized in three main sections: \\n 1.  Introductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to \\nProject Risk Management processes as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide –  Fourth Edition. \\n 2.  Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth \\nEdition. The six processes are as follows: \\n Plan Risk Management, • \\n Identify Risks, • \\n Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis, • \\n Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, • \\n Plan Risk Responses, and • \\n Monitor and Control Risks. • \\n Each of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics: \\n( a  ) purpose and objectives of the process; ( b  ) critical success factors for the process; ( c   ) tools and \\ntechniques for the process; and ( d    ) documenting the results of the process. \\n 3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard. \\n This practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive, \\nand successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for \\nseveral reasons: \\n 1.  Principles are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and \\ntechniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence. \\n 2.  Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk \\nManagement. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to \\napply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is \\ntailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There \\nare many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of Project Risk Management as presented in this practice standard. \\n 3.  The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, reﬂ  ecting the many \\nbusiness and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures \\nbetween commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations, and the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams. \\n The principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can \\nestablish processes speciﬁ  c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with these principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.    \n",

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n 1.2 Project Risk Management Deﬁ  nition \\n The deﬁ  nition of Project Risk Management, as deﬁ  ned in the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, is the basis \\nfor this practice standard: “Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting \\nrisk management planning, identiﬁ  cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The  PMBOK   \\n®  Guide –  Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the \\nprobability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the \\nproject.” In the  PMBOK   ®  Guide  – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, \\nhas a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost, and quality. \\n Project Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide \\naction-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may \\nor may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to other dimensions such as their impact on objectives. \\n 1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management \\n Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. \\nIt should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In \\nthis way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every process group. \\n Many of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to ﬁ  nal design \\nand from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often \\nassume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of project risks. \\n Project Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it \\nbuilds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty. Quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates \\nand critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project. \\n Project Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary, \\nProject Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and change management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of conﬁ  dence for meeting project objectives.    \n",

In the early stages of a project, the level of \\nrisk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not \\nmean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different \\nways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the \\nmore realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. \\n A risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life \\ncycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk \\nmanagement continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and cost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project ﬂ  exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop. \\n It is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in \\nplace, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced. \\nDuring project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future. \\n Finally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to \\ncontribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management practice. \\n 1.4 Good Risk Management Practice \\n Project Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of \\nthe other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be \\nconducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other processes involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is appropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the \\nmulti-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture projects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe. \\n Changes in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may \\nrequire decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets, make commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of accounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and external requirements.    \n",

Practice Standard for Project Risk Management1 CHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n Project Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project \\nManagement code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing \\nwith others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk \\nManagement beneﬁ  ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement \\namong stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identiﬁ  cation, analysis, and response, in particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other unreasonable inﬂ  uences. \\n Project Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of \\ntools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the \\ncharacteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large project that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and attention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted \\nin the background with a ﬂ  exible deadline. \\n Each of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under \\nmanagement during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions made in that process remain appropriate. \\n 1.5 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management \\n Figure 1-2.
