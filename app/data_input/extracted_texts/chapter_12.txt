 TOOLS, TECHNIQUES AND TEMPLATES FOR 
PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Many tools and techniques have been developed and are in widespread use to support the Project Risk 
Management processes. The most commonly used of these are listed in the following tables along with their 
strengths, weaknesses, and critical success factors. Where a technique can be used in more than one Project 
Risk Management process, it is described in detail in the section associated with the main process that it 
supports, and referred to as necessary for other processes to which it can be of use. Examples and templates 
shown after each table provide illustrations of the most common and good practice uses of these tools and 
techniques. This information is not intended to explain the tools and techniques but to list them with certain 
important characteristics. Those who are interested in learning more are encouraged to seek other sources 
such as handbooks, textbooks, or courses in project risk management. 
 D.1  Techniques, Examples and Templates for 
Risk Management Planning (Chapter 4) 
 Plan Risk Management deﬁ nes the approach to be followed for managing the risks throughout the lifespan 
of the corresponding project.

 Status report templates 
• 
 Typical agenda for status meetings 
• 
 D.1.1.3 Risk Statement “Metalanguage” 
 In order for all risks to be clearly deﬁ ned, a standard structure for the way in which the risk is described 
should be speciﬁ ed and applied. A typical such statement is: 
 “Because of <one or more causes>, <risk> might occur, which would lead to <one or more effects>”. 

D
 D.1.1.4 Risk Prioritization and Selection Guidelines 
 The selection and prioritization of risks must be linked to the project objectives. The risk management plan 
will deﬁ ne the relative importance to be assigned to these objectives (e.g. reliability takes precedence over 
time, etc.): this may be in the form of numerical “weights” that can be applied to create a single weighted sum 
over all objectives for each risk. Any other features that may affect the urgency of dealing with a risk should 
also be speciﬁ ed (e.g. one linked to a resource that will soon disappear should be given greater urgency). 
 D.2 Techniques, Examples and Templates for Identify Risks (Chapter 5) 
 Identify Risks is carried out in order to develop a comprehensive list of all knowable uncertainties that could 
have an effect on the project’s objectives.

 D.2.1 Techniques 
 Examples of techniques are given in D.2.1.1 through D.2.1.15. 
 D.2.1.1 Assumptions and Constraints Analysis 
 This technique requires three steps: 
 1. 
List assumptions and constraints for the project 
 2. 
Test assumptions and constraints by asking two questions: 
 a. Could the assumption/constraint be false? 
 b. If it were false, would one or more project objectives be affected (positively or negatively)? 
 3. 
 Where both questions are answered “Yes”, generate a risk, for example in the form: <Assumption/
constraint> may prove false, leading to <effect on objective(s)>. 
 The results can be documented in table form, as shown in Figure D1. 
  Table D2. Identify Risks (continued) 


Figure 12-1: Assumption or Constraint Assessment Table

This image presents a table for assessing assumptions or constraints in a project. The columns include:
1. Assumption or Constraint
2. Could this assumption/constraint prove false? (Y/N)
3. If false, would it affect the project? (Y/N)
4. Convert to a risk?


Figure 12-2: Staff Leaving Risk Factors

This image shows a diagram that depicts factors contributing to staff leaving a project or organization. The diagram highlights:
- Environment (Variety, Challenges, Recognition)
- Ambition (Satisfaction)
- Career Prospects (Remuneration)
- Staff leaving (Exit)

D
  Figure D1. Example of a Constraint Analysis with Fields for Description and Analysis Results 
  D.2.1.2 Brainstorming 
 Brainstorming is commonly used in a facilitated risk identiﬁ cation workshop to identify risks. The standard 
rules of brainstorming are often modiﬁ ed when the technique is applied to risk identiﬁ cation. For example it 
is common to structure the risk identiﬁ cation brainstorm using risk categories or a risk breakdown structure. 
Some evaluation of proposed risks is often included in a risk identiﬁ cation brainstorm to remove non-risks. It is 
important to ensure active participation of relevant stakeholders in a risk identiﬁ cation brainstorm, and for the 
facilitator to manage group dynamics carefully. No templates or examples are presented in this appendix. 
 D.2.1.3 Cause and Effect (Ishikawa) Diagrams 
 This technique presents in diagrammatic form the causes which contribute to a given outcome. Each main 
cause can be split further into sub-causes. To use this technique for risk identiﬁ cation the outcome should be stated 
as an effect on a project objective, i.e. the impact of a risk. The diagram then identiﬁ es risks as those uncertain 
events which could result in occurrence of the impact. Care needs to be taken when using this technique for 
risk identiﬁ cation to distinguish between risks (uncertain causes of the impact) and issues (certain causes of the 
impact). An example cause and effect (Ishikawa) diagram is shown below: the risk (effect) to be analyzed is “staff 
leaving the project”; the main causes are Environment, Ambition, Career Prospects, Satisfaction, Remuneration. 
  Figure D2. Example of a Cause and Effect or Ishikawa Diagram for Staff Leaving

This image presents a table with the following columns:
1. Risk Category
2. Subcategory
3. Example Risks
4. Could this risk affect our project? (Yes/No/Don't Know/Not applicable)

D
  D.2.1.4 Checklists 
 Checklists are compiled to capture previous project experience and allow it to be used for subsequent similar 
projects. It is possible to structure the risk identiﬁ cation checklist around a risk breakdown structure, as shown 
in the partial example below. It is useful to present the checklist as a set of risks, each of which is considered in 
turn to determine whether it might be relevant to the project under consideration. Risk identiﬁ cation checklists 
should include both threats and opportunities. 
  . 
 Figure D3. Example (Fragment) of a Checklist with Typical Structure of Category, Subcategory, 
Specific Risks and Effect 
  D.2.1.5 Delphi Technique 
 The Delphi technique uses a facilitated anonymous polling of subject matter experts to identify risks in their 
area of expertise. The facilitator gathers the experts’ initial responses and circulates them without attribution 
to the group, who may revise their contributions based on those of others. The process often generates a 
consensus of the experts in a few iterations. No templates or examples are presented. 
 D.2.1.6 Document Review 
 Risks can be identiﬁ ed through careful review of project documentation, including the project charter, 
statement of work, contract terms and conditions, subcontracts, technical speciﬁ cations, regulatory 
requirements, legal stipulations etc (where relevant). Formal structured methods of document review can be 
used (such as the Fagan Inspection Process), or a more informal approach may be adopted. No templates or 
examples are presented. 
 D.2.1.7 FMEA/Fault Tree Analysis 
 Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) or Fault Tree Analysis is the analysis of a model structured to 
identify the various elements that can cause system failure by themselves, or in combination with others, 


Figure 12-4: Quantification of Fault Trees

This image represents a fault tree diagram for quantifying risks in a project. It includes:
- A probability scale (Frequent to Extremely Remote)
- Various conditions (e.g., car at main road junction, driver did not stop) with probabilities

D
based on the logic of the system. Fault tree analysis is typically used in engineering contexts. It can be adapted 
for use to identify risks by analyzing how risk impacts might arise. Another result is the probability of failure 
(or of reliability, mean time between failure, etc.) of the overall system, indicating the level of quality of the 
system or product. If the level of reliability is not acceptable, the Fault Tree can indicate where the system can 
be made more reliable—therefore, it is useful in the design and engineering phase of the project. An example 
is shown below. 
 
 Figure D4. Fault Tree Analysis of the Possible Causes of a Crash at the Main Road Junction 
 (this will be changed to be more project-oriented) 
  D.2.1.8 Force Field Analysis 
 Force Field Analysis is typically used in the change management context. It can be adapted for risk 
identiﬁ cation by identifying driving forces (“forces for change”) and restraining forces (“forces against change”) 
which currently affect achievement of a project objective. Risks can then be identiﬁ ed as uncertain events or 
conditions which would lead to a change in the strength of one or more of the identiﬁ ed forces. An example 
force ﬁ eld diagram is shown below. 


Figure 12-5: Forces for and Against Change

This image shows two opposing sides representing forces for and against change. It includes:
- Forces for Change (e.g., customers want new products, improve production speed)
- Forces against Change (e.g., loss of staff overtime, staff frightened of new technology)

D

  D.2.1.9 Industry Knowledge Base 
 An industry knowledge base is a special case of a checklist (see above), and is used similarly. No templates 
or examples are presented. 
 D.2.1.10 Inﬂ uence Diagrams 
 An inﬂ uence diagram is a diagrammatic representation of a project situation, showing the main entities, 
decision points, uncertainties, and outcomes, and indicating the relationships (inﬂ uences) between them. The 
inﬂ uence diagram can identify risks when combined with sensitivity analysis or Monte Carlo simulation to 
reveal sources of risk within the project. An example is shown below. 


Figure 12-6: Bid Evaluation Process

This image presents a flowchart for evaluating bids, including the following steps:
- Issue Invitation to Bid (ITB)
- Quality of ITB Information
- Competence of Bidders
- Competence of Assessment Team
- Quality of Bids
- Select Best Bid

D
 
 Figure D6. Example of an Influence Diagram in a Bidding Situation 
  D.2.1.11 Interviews 
 Risk identiﬁ cation interviews should include all main stakeholders and be conducted by an independent 
skilled interviewer using a structured agenda, in an atmosphere of conﬁ dentiality, honesty, and mutual trust. A 
risk breakdown structure, checklist or prompt list can be used as a framework for risk interviews. No templates 
or examples are presented. 
 D.2.1.12 Nominal Group Technique 
 The Nominal Group Technique is an adaptation of brainstorming where participants share and discuss all 
issues before evaluation, with each participant participating equally in evaluation. No templates or examples 
are presented. 
 D.2.1.13 Post-Project Reviews/Lessons Learned/Historical Information 
 Information relevant to risks for a current project can be obtained by reviewing databases of risks which 
occurred in previous similar situations. Such databases might arise from post-project reviews or lessons 
learned exercises. They may also exist as repositories of historical information, either within an organization or 
industry body. No templates or examples are presented. 

D
 D.2.1.14 Prompt Lists 
 A prompt list is a set of risk categories which can be used to stimulate risk identiﬁ cation. The prompt list 
may be presented as a risk breakdown structure (see below), or as a set of headings. A number of standard 
prompt lists have been developed for use in risk identiﬁ cation, and some of these are presented below. These 
can then be used as a framework for other risk identiﬁ cation techniques such as brainstorming (see D.2.1.2) 
or risk interviews (see D2.1.11).

 D.2.1.15 Questionnaire 
 A risk identiﬁ cation questionnaire can be presented as a special form of checklist (see D.2.1.4), where 
possible risks are shown in question format (for example “Is the client’s requirement clearly deﬁ ned?”) rather 


Figure 12-7: Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)

This image shows a hierarchical Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS), with different levels of risk including:
- RBS Level 0: All Sources of Project Risk
- RBS Level 1: Categories such as Technical Risk, Management Risk, Commercial Risk, External Risk
- RBS Level 2: Specific subcategories like Scope Definition, Project Management, Contractual Terms

D
than as risk statements (“The client may change the requirement after project start.”). Alternatively a risk 
identiﬁ cation questionnaire can be used to present the headings from a prompt list (see D.2.1.14), asking 
questions such as “Are there any uncertainties arising from the use of technology on this project?” No templates 
or examples are presented. 
 D.2.1.16 Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) 
 The risk breakdown structure (RBS) is a hierarchical framework of potential sources of risk to a project. An 
organization may develop a generic RBS for use across all its projects, or a project may use a project-speciﬁ c 
RBS. A partial example RBS is shown below. 
 
 Figure D7. Example of a Generic Risk Breakdown Structure 


Figure 12-8: Phase Entry and Reporting Issues

This image shows the relationship between incorrect reporting, incomplete requirements, and their impacts, including:
- Mistrust, Repeated Audits, Rework, Extra Cost, Schedule Slips, Low Morale

D
  D.2.1.17 Root-Cause Analysis 
 A root cause analysis seeks to identify basic causes of risks that may be visible symptoms of more 
fundamental forces. It may also identify common sources of several risks, leading to broad-reaching risk 
response strategies. Similarly, care needs to be taken when using this technique for risk identiﬁ cation to 
distinguish between risks (uncertain causes of the impact) and issues (certain causes of the impact). In the 
diagram shown below the risks that were initially identiﬁ ed included rework, extra cost, schedule slips, low 
team morale, customer mistrust and repeated audits. An examination of the identiﬁ ed risks lead to a common 
root cause, that later phases of the project were typically started before the earlier ones were sufﬁ ciently 
mature. This organization repeatedly ignored the proper phase entry prerequisites, hastening later project 
stages in order to speed up the project. 
 
 Figure D8. Example of a Root Cause Analysis 
  D.2.1.18 SWOT Analysis 
 SWOT Analysis identiﬁ es four characteristics of a given situation: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and 
threats. The technique is commonly used in strategic decision making. It can be adapted for risk identiﬁ cation 
by changing the interpretation of the four perspectives, such that strengths and weaknesses relate to the 
characteristics of the organization conducting the project, and opportunities and threats identify the project 
risks. The technique is particularly useful for identifying internally-generated risks arising from within the 
organization. For example opportunities might be found by leveraging organizational strengths, or threats 
might arise as a result of organizational weaknesses, as illustrated below. 


Figure 12-9: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) Analysis

This image outlines the SWOT analysis process with the following steps:
1. Identify and list organizational strengths and weaknesses.
2. Derive opportunities from strengths and threats from weaknesses using risk metalanguage.

  Figure D9. Example of a SWOT Analysis Structure 
  D.2.1.19 System Dynamics 
 System dynamics (SD) is a particular application of inﬂ uence diagrams (see above), and can be used 
to identify risks within a project situation. The SD model represents entities and information ﬂ ows within a 
project, and analysis of the model can reveal feed-back and feed-forward loops which lead to uncertainty 
or instability. In addition, the results of an SD analysis can show the impact of risk events on overall project 
results, such as the cost or schedule results to be expected. Analyses of changes in the model or assumptions 
can indicate the system’s sensitivity to speciﬁ c events, some of which may be risks. A simple example of an 
SD diagram is shown in Figure D11.

 D.2.1.20 WBS Review 
 The work breakdown structure (WBS) for a project can form a framework for a number of other risk identiﬁ cation 
techniques, such as brainstorming, risk interviews, checklists or prompt lists. No templates or examples are presented. 
 D.3  Techniques, Examples and Templates for Perform Qualitative Risk 
Analysis (Chapter 6) 
 Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis prioritizes for further analysis or handling the undifferentiated list of risks 
that have been identiﬁ ed in the Identify Risks process. Organizations tend to apply resources to those designated 
as “high risk,” based on their priority, often indicated by the risks’ probability and impact characteristics.

 D.3.1.1 Estimating Techniques Applied to Probability and Impact 
 The probability of a risk occurring can be speciﬁ ed in several different ways. One common way is to assign 
levels of risk probability by ranges of probability. One beneﬁ t of this approach is that the subject matter experts 
only need to assess a risk’s probability within a range rather than as a speciﬁ c value. An example, assuming 
that a 5×5 Probability and Impact Matrix is desired, is shown in Figure D11 where the probability ranges are 
more tightly deﬁ ned at low levels of probability. 
 Examples of impact level deﬁ nitions are very project-speciﬁ c. The values used to specify the level of impact 
from very low to very high (if a 5×5 matrix is being used) should be: 
  Higher impact, for threats or opportunities, as they move from very low to very high for a speciﬁ c 
• 
objective 
  Levels are deﬁ ned by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain to the project for 
• 
each level across objectives 
  If a risk’s possible impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level of impact (e.g. 
• 
from moderate to high) the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents 
the expected or average impact. Alternatively, the risk may be ﬂ agged for extra analysis in order to 
reduce the range of uncertainty to ﬁ t within a single range. 
 An example of impact level deﬁ nitions is shown in Figure D11. These deﬁ nitions should be tailored or scaled 
by stakeholders to the speciﬁ c project. The deﬁ nitions, appropriately tailored to the project, can be used for 
opportunities and threats.

reduced functionality. 
  D.3.1.2 
Probability and Impact Matrix 
 Organizations typically assess a risk’s priority on an objective from the combination of probability of 
occurrence and impact on that project objective, using deﬁ nitions such as those shown in Figure D11. Risks 
are then placed on a probability and impact (P-I) matrix, such as one shown below. This matrix includes both 
threats and opportunities.

This image includes a table showing how preference factors are rated and calculated using a matrix. The categories include cost, time, scope, and quality.

D
 D.3.1.3 Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) 
 AHP is a method to calibrate preferences for achieving the different objectives of a project. Do they prefer 
to achieve time more than cost? Is quality more important than scope? What is the relative weighting of the 
project’s objectives in terms of their priority to the stakeholders or to management? The results are weights 
(summing to 100%) that reﬂ ect the relative priority of each objective. This prioritization can be important in 
determining how trade-offs affecting different objectives (e.g., Should we reduce scope to ﬁ nish on time?) 
will be decided. It can also be used to create an overall project risk priority list from risks that have been 
assessed on their implications for individual objectives. Specialized software implementing AHP is available. A 
spreadsheet implementation is shown below.

 D.4  Techniques, Examples and Templates for Perform Quantitative Risk 
Analysis (Chapter 7) 
 Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis seeks to determine the overall risk to project objectives when all risks 
potentially operate simultaneously on the project. It provides answers to several questions: 
  How likely is the project to complete on the schedule date or earlier? How likely is the project actual cost 
• 
to be the budgeted cost or less? How reliable will the product be that the project produces? What is the 
best decision to make in the face of uncertain results? 
  How much contingency in time and cost is needed to provide the organization with its desired degree of 
• 
conﬁ dence in the results? How should the design of the product or system be changed most economically 
to increase its reliability? 
 What are the individual risks that seem to be the most important in determining the overall project risk?

 D.4.1.1 Decision Tree Analysis 
 Decision tree analysis is usually performed using specialized, but widely available software. The software 
allows the user to specify the structure of the decision with decision nodes, chance nodes, costs, beneﬁ ts, and 
probabilities. The user can also evaluate the different decisions using linear utility functions based on Expected 
Monetary Value or on non-linear utility functions of various shapes. An example is shown below where: 
 The negative numbers represent outﬂ ows or investments (e.g. COTS) 
• 
 The percentages represent probabilities of the event occurring (e.g., Major Problems) 
• 
 The positive numbers represent rewards or values (e.g., after “Fix the Problem”) 
• 
 “True” indicates the decision option taken from the square decision node, whereas “false” 
• 
indicates the decision option not taken

  D.4.1.2 Expected Monetary Value 
 Expected Monetary Value (EMV) is a simple calculation of a value such as weighted average or expected cost 
or beneﬁ t when the outcomes are uncertain. All reasonable alternative outcomes are identiﬁ ed. Their probabilities 
of occurring (summing to 100%) and their values are estimated. The EMV calculation is made for the entire event 
by weighting the individual possible outcomes by their probabilities of occurring, as shown in Figure D15. 
   D.4.1.3 Monte Carlo Simulation 
 Monte Carlo simulation is a detailed, computer-intensive simulation approach to determining the value and 
probability of possible outcomes of a project objective such as a project schedule (e.g., the completion date) or 
cost estimate (e.g., the total cost). It computes the schedule or cost estimate many times using inputs drawn at

items. The solutions using these different input values are used to build a histogram of possible project outcomes 
and their relative probability, and cumulative probability from which to compute desired contingency reserves of

and schedule. Examples of the output of schedule and cost risk results are shown in Figures D16 and D17.

Figure 12-18: Option Comparison Table

This table compares two options (A and B) based on weighted criteria such as price, functionality, ease of use, and lead time, with scores calculated for each option.

D
 D.5.1.1 Contingency Planning 
 For speciﬁ c (normally high-impact) risks, the risk owner may choose to assemble a team to develop a 
response, as if the risk had genuinely happened. The corresponding plan, with the supporting information, 
should then be documented and approved at project management or sponsor level. This approval must include 
authorization to deploy the corresponding resources if the predeﬁ ned trigger conditions arise. No templates or 
examples are presented. 
 D.5.1.2 Contingency Reserve Estimation 
 All of the conditional response plans, as well any of the residual risks will, if they occur, have an effect on the 
schedule and/or budget and/or performance objectives of the project. An amount (time and cost) needs to be 
set aside to allow for these eventualities. This amount is made up of two components: those to cover speciﬁ c, 
approved conditional responses (e.g. contingency plans), and those to address unspeciﬁ ed or passively accepted 
risks. Quantitative methods (see chapter 7) can be used to determine the amounts that should be set aside (e.g. 
decision trees for conditional responses, simulation for the set of unspeciﬁ ed risks). These reserves are tracked 
and managed in Monitor and Control Risks (chapter 9). No templates or examples are presented. 
 D.5.1.3 Multi-Criteria Selection Techniques 
 This is an adaptation of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process (chapter 6) based on selection criteria. 
The example below shows the use of a spreadsheet to calculate the weighted scores of two options, based on 
a predeﬁ ned set of prioritized criteria: “points” is the product of “weight” by “rating.” 
 
 Figure D18. Example of Comparing Options by their Ratings Along Four Prioritized Criteria 
 D.5.1.4 Scenario Analysis 
 Scenario analysis for risk response planning involves deﬁ ning several plausible alternative scenarios (e.g. 
no change and all goes to plan, disaster occurs, utopia etc). The different scenarios may require different risk 
responses that can be described and evaluated for their cost and effectiveness. If the organization can choose 
between scenarios, the alternatives including the responses can be compared. If the scenarios are out of the 
control of the organization, the scenario analysis can lead to effective and necessary contingency planning.

 D.6.1.1 Reserve Analysis 
 An analytical technique to determine the essential features and relationships of components in the 
project management plan to establish a reserve for the schedule duration, budget, estimated cost, or 
funds for a project. Tracking the state of the reserve through project execution will provide summary 
information as to the evolution of the status of the corresponding risks. This information can be useful 
when reporting up the organization to those responsible for several projects. In addition, once a 
corresponding risk occurs or ceases to be current (i.e. when it can no longer impact the project), the 
corresponding reserve needs to be reviewed in order to assess whether it still provides the agreed level 
of confidence. 
 Time buffers can be used in two different ways: 
 To provide for accepted schedule risks, as described above or 
• 
 As a scheduling-related technique in critical chain project management (CCPM). 
• 
 In contrast with the contingency reserve for identified risks, the buffers in CCPM provide a shared 
mechanism for accommodating the natural variability of activity durations over a sequence (or chain) of 
activities. Tracking the rate at which each such buffer is used during project execution provides valuable 
information at a given point in time as to the level of schedule risk along that chain, and is used in 
CCPM for adapting the priority or management focus for additional analysis and as necessary triggering 
further risk management activities.

 D.6.1.2 Risk Audits 
 Risk audits are carried out in order to evaluate: 
 Are the risk management rules being carried out as speciﬁ ed ?
• 
 Are the risk management rules adequate for controlling the project ?
• 
 No templates or examples are presented. 
 D.6.1.3 Risk Reassessment 
 The objective of risk reassessment is to ensure that the full risk management cycle is repeated as required 
to ensure effective control. See Figure D20.

 D.6.1.4 Status Meetings 
 Risks can and should be on the agenda at all project reviews. Typically, the agenda items should cover the 
following: 
 Top priority risks at present. 
• 
 Are there any changes? 
 
○
 Risks or trigger conditions that have occurred .
• 
 What is the status of the actions? 
 
○

D
 Risks responded to in the last period .
• 
 Effectiveness of actions taken .
 
○
 Are there any additional actions required? 
 
○
 Risks closed in the last period .
• 
 Impact on the plans .
 
○
 Lessons to be added to the Organizational Process Assets .

 D.6.1.5 Trend Analysis 
 The evolution of the variance values over time should be analyzed in order to evaluate how the risk proﬁ le 
is changing, whether previous actions are having the expected effect and whether additional actions are 
required. The Earned Value formulae of the “to complete performance index” can be used to assess changes 
with respect to time and cost. No templates or examples are presented. 
 D.6.1.6 Variance Analysis 
 The formulae in Earned Value Analysis (CV, SV, CPI, SPI) can be used to set thresholds for action, and to 
indicate when the risk process may be ineffective. Earned value management systems (EVMS) use variance 
from plan as the basis of forecasts or extrapolations to the cost at completion. Projections made using EVMS 
have been shown by experience to be reliable early in the project, e.g., 20% into the execution. No templates 
or examples are presented.
