 GUIDELINES FOR A PMI PRACTICE STANDARD 
 A.1  Introduction 
 A PMI practice standard is characterized as follows: 
  Each practice standard provides guidelines on the mechanics (e.g., nuts and bolts, basics, 
• 
fundamentals, step-by-step usage guide, how it operates, how to do it) of some signiﬁ cant process 
(input, tool, technique, or output) that is relevant to a project manager. 
  A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the life-cycle phases of many projects; however, an 
• 
individual practice standard may be applicable to the completion of one or more phases within a 
project. 
  A practice standard does not necessarily mirror the Knowledge Areas within  
• 
A Guide to the Project 
Management Body of Knowledge ( PMBOK ®  Guide –Fourth Edition), although an individual practice 
standard will provide sufﬁ cient detail and background for one or more of the inputs, tools and 
techniques, and/or outputs. Therefore, practice standards are not required to use the name of any 
Knowledge Area. 
  Each practice standard should include information on what the signiﬁ cant process is and does, 
• 
why it is signiﬁ cant, how to perform it, when it should be performed, and, if necessary for further 
clariﬁ cation, who should perform it. 
  Each practice standard should include information that is accepted and applicable for most projects 
• 
most of the time within the project management community. Processes that are generally restricted or 
applicable to one industry, country, or companion profession (i.e., an  application area ) may be included 
as an appendix for informational purposes, rather than as part of the practice standard. With strong 
support and evidence, an application area-speciﬁ c process may be considered as an extension practice 
standard, in the same manner as extensions to the  PMBOK ®  Guide –Fourth Edition are considered. 
  Each practice standard will beneﬁ t from the inclusion of examples and templates. It is best when an 
• 
example or template includes a discussion of its strengths and weaknesses. A background description 
may be necessary to put this discussion in the appropriate context. The examples should be aligned with 
the relevant information in the standard or its appendix and placed in proximity to that information. 
 All practice standards shall be written in the same general style and format. 
• 
 E ach practice standard project will be aligned with or reference other practice standards, as needed. 
• 
 Each practice standard will be consistent with the  
• 
PMBOK ®  Guide –Fourth Edition. 
 Each practice standard is intended to be more prescriptive than the  
• 
PMBOK ®  Guide –Fourth Edition.
